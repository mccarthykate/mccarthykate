After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies, I continued my education to build on my technical skills and gain professional experience in environmental monitoring. I have experience with ArcGIS and Miradi and using these tools to address environmental concerns and devise a solution. Currently, I am focusing on water resource management of riparian ecosystems, ultimately hoping to assist with aquatic ecosystem restoration projects. Upon completing my Professional Science Master’s degree, I am seeking a career in watershed management locally, in Larimer County."

    "text": "Below are projects I’ve worked on throughout my undergraduate and graduate education. They range from professional writing, to presentations, to work done for a student-run non-profit club at UCSB.\n\nFinal Environmental Impact Report View PDF\nIn my senior year, I took a class in which we were tasked with writing a focused EIR for a hypothetical combined faculty housing and classroom space project on UCSB’s campus. This EIR focuses on aesthetic resources.\n\n\nChilean Salmon Aquaculture Research Paper View PDF\nIn my Food, Agriculture, and the Environment class, we worked throughout the quarter on creating a research paper on ecological issues related to food and agriculture. I chose to research Chilean Salmon Aquaculture as Chile is the second largest producer of salmon in the world.\n\n\nAlaskan Giant Kelp Forest Conservation Plan View PDF\nFor Conservation Planning, which I took in my senior year, I worked collaboratively with other students to create a conservation plan for a specific ecosystem, electing to protect the Alaskan Giant Kelp Forest. The comprehensive plan covers planning context, the planning team and management process, situation analysis, project scope, fundamental objectives, desired outcomes, conservation features, the range of strategies, strategy selection, data and knowledge, and risks/uncertainties.\n\n\nPublic Comment on BOEM Project View PDF\nIn Intro to Environmental Law, we prepared public comment on a hypothetical project proposed by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) to build an offshore computer chip manufacturing facility. The comment advises the level of review, impacts to consider, mitigation measures, alternatives, and agency requirements by the Endangered Species Act.\n\n\nIsla Vista Trading Post 2024 Zine View PDF\nIn my undergrad, I was part of a club, Isla Vista Trading Post (IVTP), that promoted sustainable fashion, mostly by hosting 3-For-Free events, where students and community members could get 3 free items of clothing donated from the community. As co-outreach director, I was tasked with creating the zine for 2024. We created a physical zine to distribute to the community to spread the word about our club and educate readers on topics ranging from upcycling tutorials and thrifting tips to articles on haul culture and animal exploitation.\n\n\nIsla Vista Trading Post Website Visit Site\nAnother part of my role as co-outreach director was to create the website for the club. Using a wix website, we worked to display our accomplishments, add a section for all the zines we’ve done to be accessed online, and inform people how to become part of the pick-up list for donations."
