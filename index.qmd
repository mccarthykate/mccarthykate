I am a graduate student at Colorado State studying ecosystem science and sustainability. After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Environmental Studies, I continued my education to build on my technical skills and gain professional experience in environmental monitoring. I have experience with ArcGIS and Miradi and using these tools to address environmental concerns and devise a solution. Currently, I am focusing on water resource management of riparian ecosystems, ultimately hoping to assist with aquatic ecosystem restoration projects. Upon completing my Professional Science Master’s degree, I am seeking a career in watershed management locally, in Larimer County.
